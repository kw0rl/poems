                    <p class="poem-excerpt">the last of my letter<br>
                        in the labyrinthine of his mind<br>
                        struggling to find the answer<br>
                        somewhere in gray nebulous<br>
                        could he sense of uncertainty<br>
                        my boy only knows what he wants<br>
                        only knows what he should have<br>
                        and no the action presents<br>
                        amidst the twilight's melancholy hue<br>
                        you give me a sign to dance<br>
                        an ambivalent dance, conflicting brew<br>
                        i could hear your mellifluous voice while we're watching Veronica ephemerally<br>
                        and we were playing some unknown game<br>
                        lost the game with no disappointments<br>
                        but never your face somewhere in front of my eyes<br>
                        the ephemeral dance of our tangled hearts<br>
                        we waltz between doubt and hope<br>
                        eventually we waltz between hope and doubt<br>
                        not sure where to start<br>
                        yet uncertainty lingers like a tattoo kiss<br>
                        never ending saga<br>
                        i want you to know<br>
                        every our delicate dance<br>
                        every tangled knots in the fabric<br>
                        becomes a nuisance to us<br>
                        and welcoming an unwelcome dance<br>
                        this letter is not truly my last letter<br>
                        because it holds an encapsulated lifeline.<br>
