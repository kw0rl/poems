                        in the labyrinthine of his mind<br>
                        struggling to find the answer<br>
                        somewhere in gray nebulous<br>
                        could he sense of uncertainty<br>
                        my boy only knows what he wants<br>
                        only knows what he should have<br>
                        and no the action presents<br>
                        amidst the twilight's melancholy hue<br>
                        you give me a sign to dance<br>
                        an ambivalent dance, conflicting brew<br>
                        i could hear your mellifluous voice while we're watching Veronica ephemerally<br>
                        and we were playing some unknown game<br>
                        lost the game with no disappointments<br>
                        but never your face somewhere in front of my eyes<br>
                        the ephemeral dance of our tangled hearts<br>
                        we waltz between doubt and hope<br>
                        eventually we waltz between hope and doubt<br>
                        not sure where to start<br>
                        yet uncertainty lingers like a tattoo kiss<br>
                        never ending saga<br>
                        i want you to know<br>
                        every our delicate dance<br>
                        every tangled knots in the fabric<br>
                        becomes a nuisance to us<br>
                        and welcoming an unwelcome dance<br>
                        this letter is not truly my last letter<br>
                        because it holds an encapsulated lifeline.<br>

                        i'm taking the first grave:<br>
                        the moment of cold moon<br>
                        waving to the ghost<br>
                        watching it through the window<br>
                        couldn't even say one thing<br>
                        as you sure the floor cracked as you dance with it<br>
                        why would you still remain standing there?<br>
                        you show the enthusiasm toward it so hard<br>
                        not even bother to move from the floor<br>
                        we were so delicate<br>
                        it tries to present in your air<br>
                        because it feels like a rarest air<br>
                        for not sure certain times before<br>
                        and you are not sure either wants to be there<br>
                        you said you'd come and get me but it
                        seems like it's not<br>
                        you look so pale<br>
                        what led you into that?<br>
                        that such maladies<br>
                        did i cause it?<br>
                        no one could even cure them<br>
                        did i left it to you?<br>
                        am i killing your joy?<br>
                        i supposed said "burn that witch!" then<br>
                        don't you die<br>
                        you'll find someone<br>
                        you can mark my word, i said it first<br>
                        no one want it, but someone will to you<br>
                        no such thing to worry<br>

                        when i was rambling and it didn't make sense<br>
                        crying like you do<br>
                        it was sleepless nights<br>
                        what the hell did i do<br>
                        saying i miss you<br>
                        saying i loved you<br>
                        maybe we can be transparent telling all the lies we kept for<br>
                        i don't mind if it was about a year of mess that it did to you<br>
                        at least it sounds like it makes sense<br>
                        late night talk<br>
                        hand wrapped in a hand<br>
                        light gesture caressed on cheek<br>
                        the gazes locked<br>
                        i miss that<br>
                        i love that<br>
                        one more sleepless night<br>
                        you color my dream<br>
                        we smiled through that imaginary world<br>
                        you defended me from the tiger i fear the most<br>
                        then cool me down<br>
                        and found myself wide awake every three or four in the morning<br>
                        maybe i'm the problem<br>
                        i can say bunches of words, poets, articles, histories, stories, lies, truths, debates<br>
                        but i am bad at showing actions<br>
                        yes, i was wrong <br>
                        don't want to feel this blue<br>
                        that i miss you<br>
                        when my sun still lingers your sky<br>
                        the only thing that left is my love to you<br>
                        the love you that you may you won't have it the same<br>
